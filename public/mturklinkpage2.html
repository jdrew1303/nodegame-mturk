        <br>


          <ul>

          <li>
            <strong>Purpose:</strong> Scientific
            experiment to understand how individuals interact and make
            decisions in groups.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>What you will do:</strong> You will play an
            interactive game with other human participants. You might
            need to wait a short while until all participants have
            joined the experiment.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Requirements:</strong>
            <ol>
              <li>You must have <em>not</em> played a HIT called
                "Artex" before</li>
              <li>Your browser must accept cookies and have
                JavaScript enabled</li>
              <li>Only the browsers Chrome >= 20,
                Safari >= 6, Firefox >= 20, IE >= 10, Opera >= 12 are allowed
                to play</li>
              <li>Due to the special game interface, you cannot
              participate from tablets or mobile phones</li>
              <li>Due to the special game interface, your screen must
              have a resolution of 1366x768px or more</li>
            </ol>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Time required:</strong> Approximately 25 to 35
            minutes.
          </li>


          <li>
            <strong>Compensation:</strong> You will receive 1 dollar
            for completing the task, plus a variable bonus. The exact
            amount of the bonus depends on your choices and the
            choices of other participants in the game. We expect the
            bonus to vary between 2 and 4 dollars.
          </li>

        <ul>

          <li>
            <strong>Confidentiality:</strong> In order to guaranteee
            the unbiased behavior of future participants of this
            scientific experiment, you agree <em>not to disclose</em>
            information about the rules of the game, its interface, or
            the strategy of play to other turkers and/or to the
            general public.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Trouble Ticket:</strong> In case of any technical
            issues, or a delay with the payment, please search for a HIT
            called "Artex Trouble Ticket" and report your issues there.
          </li>

          <li><strong>Synchronicity:</strong> This is
            a <em>synchronous</em> task with other human participants
            that must wait for each other. If you accept this HIT
            don't let the others wait for you, you <em>must</em> begin
            the experiment <em>immediately!</em>

        <h4>Consent Form to Participate in Scientific Research</h4>
        <br>

        <p>
          We would like to invite you to participate in a web-based
          online experiment. The experiment is part of a research
          study whose purpose is to study how groups perform and
          collaborate. A single experimental session should take
          about 35 minutes to complete.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>You must be at least 18 years old to participate
            in these experiments.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>The decision to participate in this research
            project is voluntary.</strong> You do not have to
          participate and you can refuse to answer any
          question. Even if you begin the web-based experiments, you
          can stop at any time by closing your browser.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>There are no foreseeable risks or discomforts to
            you for taking part in this study.</strong> We anticipate that it will
          take you as little as 25 minutes and as many as 35 minutes to complete
          this task. However, you will only be rewarded for completing the task,
          not for the length of time you participate.
        </p>

        <p>
          There will be compensated for good faith participation in
          this experiment. Submitted HITs will be rejected if they are completed
          in a manner that appears to be random, incomplete, or otherwise
          negligent.

          Office of Naval Research may have access to anonymized experimental
          research records. However, because of the nature of electronic
          systems, it is possible that respondents could be identified by some
          electronic record associated with the response. Neither the researcher
          nor anyone involved with this study will be capturing those data. Any
          reports or publications based on this research will use only group
          data and will not identify you or any individual as being affiliated
          with this project. The only individually-identifying data we receive
          from Mechanical Turk are your unique identifier and your country.
          Your data are also stored on Mechanical Turk's servers, and the data
